          How can a design platform, made for and loved by designers, be improved?

        <p>
          When presented with the opportunity of a design print with the various Kleiner Perkins partners, I was most excited to look at Figma. I’ve started using it for almost everything: work projects, user testing, personal vector art, and even to create my resume. Its collaboration and sharing features are unparalleled and have redefined design teams. I believe that working towards these design values and making tools for designers that are truly intuitive and approachable is a small first step that can combat the lack of diversity in design.
          <br><br>
          Though excited, I was also nervous– navigating a design project completely on my own is never ideal, since I believe incorporating as many voices as possible is key to truly inclusive design.

        <h1>What we looked into</h1>
        <h2>
          How do readers share news and consume shared news?
        </h2>
        <p>
          With user interviews, we aimed to gain insight into how users comprehend, understand, and learn from the news, as well as how they spread this by sharing articles.
        </p>

        <p> Key takeaways: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many users discover news articles through Twitter, a few younger people through Reddit. The bottomline was that most people engaged with news via social media, particularly around infographics that could compress an incredibly nuanced issue into 4 square slides.
          </li>
          <li>
            People who share news tend to share one-on-one through message apps, and they often have a specific point from the news article in mind that they want to discuss. This often takes the form of sending friends a screenshot of a certain paragraph, a “copy + paste”d quote, or sending the entire link itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some readers have strong feelings against biased news and care deeply about reading the “truth.” Since this worry was often not addressed on the news-provider side (which again, could be social media), there was a lot of effort put on these people to “fact-check”, cross-reference sources, and look for the “primary” source themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Given these insights, as well as constraints on our own timeline and technical capabilities, we settled on creating a Google Chrome extension that allows users to seamlessly create quote graphics while also integrating smoothly with readers’ existing news habits. This led a redesigned user experience shown below in a task flow:

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Starting with a base design, we conducted 3 rounds of user testing, focusing on user preferences regarding the order of display options, color and template variations, and hidden buttons.
