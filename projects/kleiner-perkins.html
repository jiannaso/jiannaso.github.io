        <h1 >Prompt 1</h2>
        <h2>What impact do you want to have on the world and why?</h2>
        <p>
          Design has the potential to facilitate <b>empowering interactions</b> and <b>a sense of belonging</b>, but the reverse is true as well. Even at a place like Stanford, which is world-renowned for being “innovative”, <b>overlooked design details make people feel like outsiders at a place they expect to call home</b>. This holds true for my wheelchair-abled friends on campus. At the library, they are unable to roll down the ADA-compliant side ramp because bike racks are blocking its entrance. When they visit dorms, they are unable to visit their friends upstairs because there are no elevators.
  <br><br>
  Recently, I facilitated a conference at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education on accessibility issues in online learning and how the tech industry can work towards solutions. During the event, a mother shed tears as she shared stories of her autistic son who needs in-person cues to learn from others and let his teacher know when he’s feeling too anxious to pay proper attention; Zoom makes this interaction impossible. Another parent shared that though their students were given laptops, they had no idea how to help in using them. 7 months into remote learning, these students and families are still not being centered in online solutions.
  <br><br>
  Because of stories like this, I dream of and am working towards a world where the first question on designers’ minds is, <b>“who are we leaving out?”</b>. The way I approach every project is with this vision in mind. By asking more inclusive questions, we can radically expand the human experience.

        <div class="offset" id="prompt2">
        </div>
        <h1>Prompt 2</h1>
        <h2>Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up listening to my mom’s stories of how her father, a selfless pro-bono lawyer in their Philippine province, would get into arguments with her mother after once again accepting <b>kamote</b> (sweet potatoes) as compensation from a client that didn’t have the money to pay for his services. My grandfather’s kamote modeled an unparalleled dedication to justice I wanted to follow, even as my dream to become a human rights lawyer like him shifted to a career in product design.
<br><br>
This passion to work towards justice only strengthens as I see people with the power to make positive change doing the opposite. As an Undergraduate Senator working with the service workers’ union at Stanford, I heard management’s threats to report their workers to ICE after they spoke out about being mistreated in the workplace. As Chief of Staff of Stanford’s student government, I witnessed administration disregard student advocacy regarding new Title IX policies that do little to protect survivors of sexual assault. As a Stanford student, I watched our Dean of Engineering blatantly dismiss Black students’ experiences immediately after George Floyd’s death.
<br><br>
By the past and present, I’m reminded that there is no time to hesitate in working towards justice  in every space, whether as a student leader or as a designer. I’ve come to embrace <b>design as advocacy</b>– in projects, I see myself as an advocate for user needs and aim to amplify marginalized perspectives to make products better for everyone.
