          Informing residents on the pandemic & politics
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our initial challenge was to design features that would make the LA Times’ app especially relevant to Californians’ daily lives as they navigate the local impact of the pandemic and politics. The LA Times has incredible content, such as the fire articles and interactive map shown below. Our job was to display that content creatively within the app. The final design followed the existing design closely, allowing us to focus on expanding core features.

        <h1>What we looked into</h1>
        <h2>
          How do readers use news apps?
        </h2>
        <p>
          To understand app use broadly, we talked to 23 users about their news app habits. Overall, we heard that engaging in the news is a ton of work– there were users on opposite ends of the spectrum: those who put intention behind their consumption through daily timers and self-developed algorithms, vs. those who simply saw news if it came across their social media feed. We decided to focus on the latter, whose experience is well encapsulated in the following quote:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = images ID = "project-image-hor">
        <img src="../images/LAT/2.png">
      </div>

      <div class = "text">

        <p> What else stood out: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users decided to <b>download or delete</b> apps based on how useful they were based on their personal needs <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Users decided to use news apps to <b>avoid clunky mobile web experiences</b>, important for app to be differentiated with exclusive content or more visually appealing formats, or unique features such as personalization <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Passive app use was widespread– people only used news apps when they had nothing else to do, when they wake up, in the bathroom, and this use was mostly triggered by notifications or email newsletters <br>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          How do LA Times’ reads engage with the Times?
        </h2>
        <p>
          To understand how readers interact with LA Times specifically, we extracted usage data from Google Analytics, Chartbeat, and the LA Times’ Intranet for analysis. We focused on some key questions such as: Which type of content do users visit frequent and convert on? What topics are popular based on different locations? <br><br>The numbers said:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The bounce rate in June 2020 was 34%, showing many users stay on the homepage without exploring different tabs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, utility articles constituted 46% of Top 100 articles ranked by sessions per user, meaning people actively come back to high utility content. After COVID hit, the COVID-19 Tracker led to the most conversions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          How do competitors approach the same problem?
        </h2>
        <p>
          To survey the playing field, we examined multiple direct and indirect competitors to see how users have been interacting with news elsewhere and how we can improve on our end. For every competitor, we aimed to answer these two questions, which were derived from prominent user insights:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            How does this app differentiate from the mobile web experience?
          </li>
          <li>
            Active use: How does this app create habits of opening the app actively, instead of during passive moments? How does this app trigger users to open the app in their free time? How does this app motivate users to open the app without push alerts?
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Quart’z app design below particularly excited us due to their focus on giving subscribers a unique experience that highlighted creative content.

        <p>
          Following our preliminary research, we shifted our design focus to the following question:

      <div class = images ID = "project-image-hor">

      <!-- Protoypes -->
      <a name="prototypes"></a>
      <div class = "text">
        <p>
          In answering this, we decided to focus on increasing utility and personalization within the app. Increasing utility would provide users with helpful information that empowers them to make informed life decisions, while increasing personalization would enable users to curate interesting content that is relevant to them.
        </p>
        <h1>Prototypes</h1>
        <p>
          The following designs were reached over the course of 6 weeks through 5 rounds of testing with over 50 different users total.

          We proposed adding the following modules to a completely separate “My News” section that would be curated by and for users, based on a new feature that would allow users to follow topics and content they were interested in. Users loved this approach to personalization– many even said they would love for this to replace the current LAT homepage!

            Utility: Integrated Modules
          </h2>
          <p>
            In designing for utility, we first had to define what high utility content was. Internally, the LA Times defines this content as big builds and evergreen content that remains relevant for weeks or months beyond its initial publishing. This can be tracked by analyzing which articles have the most visits per user over time. While these articles can be seen as popular, this data also points to the fact that users greatly value such information, especially as they relate to health and safety. Externally, users simply see this content as creative and artistic, according to interviews. We moved forward with the internal definition at first to explore a newer design territory on the user side.

        <div class = "text">
          <h4 id="caption"> The LAT's year-end showcase of their best internally-defined "utility" content.<h4>

          <p>
            Our first approach consisted of a sticky menu in the homepage where users could access and pin a curated list of high utility content. It allowed them to view information without clicking into an article, and kept relevant content easily accessible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "text">
          <p>
            Users were excited by this idea. However, they were initially confused about what “Pinned” meant and only understood better after exploring the different types of content that could be included. Though the placement on the homepage was ideal for access, users thought it was too small of a space for exploring the content. <br><br>We also realized that it was confusing for users to see all the utility content under one name, so we broadened our definition of utility to include more content and provide users with more context, now including lifestyle guides such as financial and career advice (beyond evergreen content and big builds), and re-categorized this content to break it down to several action-oriented service journalism items. <br><br>Additionally, users confirmed what we learned from analytics– they were unlikely to go out of their way to visit other sections other than those they frequented. The final design proposal below intentionally integrated high utility content into widely used aspects of the feed and took the onus off of users to organize the content themselves.

            A ton! In terms of audience and stakeholders, this was the largest project I’ve worked on. Dealing with practical constraints and blockers, such as the engineering team’s capacity, taught me to envision solutions at different levels that could accommodate for feasibility. It was also a challenge to balance goals from the newsroom on story visibility, the business side on revenue, and our own team on staying user-centered.
            <br><br>
            On the people side, user research for this project was incredibly fun as well, since people’s news habits varied greatly– some interviewees even coded up their own RSS feeds! We also met a lot of loyal LA Times readers, and it was heartwarming to see the impact the newspaper had made on their lives for decades.

            There were points during the Utility portion of this project during which we pursued an idea for maybe more time than we should have. In future projects, I aim to take initiative in following my intuition and analyzing user research findings to explore a new path earlier.
