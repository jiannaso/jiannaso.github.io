        <h1>The Design Challenge</h1>

          How might we improve news engagement through article sharing?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our final product became a Chrome plugin that enables people to share quotes from news sites with proper context in an aesthetically-pleasing way through quote graphics. By the end of the 12 weeks, the expectation was to create an working MVP that could live on its own. Later on, the prospect of creating both an internal and external version became instrumental to the project’s success.

        <h1>What we looked into</h1>
        <h2>
          How do readers share news and consume shared news?
        </h2>
        <p>
          With user interviews, we aimed to gain insight into how users comprehend, understand, and learn from the news, as well as how they spread this by sharing articles.
        </p>

        <p> Key takeaways: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many users discover news articles through Twitter, a few younger people through Reddit. The bottomline was that most people engaged with news via social media, particularly around infographics that could compress an incredibly nuanced issue into 4 square slides.
          </li>
          <li>
            People who share news tend to share one-on-one through message apps, and they often have a specific point from the news article in mind that they want to discuss. This often takes the form of sending friends a screenshot of a certain paragraph, a “copy + paste”d quote, or sending the entire link itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some readers have strong feelings against biased news and care deeply about reading the “truth.” Since this worry was often not addressed on the news-provider side (which again, could be social media), there was a lot of effort put on these people to “fact-check”, cross-reference sources, and look for the “primary” source themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h1>Narrowing the design scope
        </h1>
        <h2>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Given these insights, as well as constraints on our own timeline and technical capabilities, we settled on creating a Google Chrome extension that allows users to seamlessly create quote graphics while also integrating smoothly with readers’ existing news habits. This led a redesigned user experience shown below in a task flow:

      <!-- Protoypes -->
      <div class = "text">
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Starting with a base design, we conducted 3 rounds of user testing, focusing on user preferences regarding the order of display options, color and template variations, and hidden buttons.
